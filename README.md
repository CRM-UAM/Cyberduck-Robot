## Summary

The principal goal of this project is to develop a line follower robot based on Arduino which uses several infrared sensors to keep on the track of the black 2cm wide line drawn on a white board. 

## Cyberduck Robot

### Components

Almost all components are repurporsed from previous projects or recycled from different objects, so I'm unable to add a link to buy the exact same components I have used in most of the cases.

- Arduino Uno with Direct Soldering
- L298n Motor Driver
- DC Gear Motor with Tire Wheels. Gear rate 1:48. 240 rpm.
- IR Sensor module (https://www.amazon.es/dp/B07G38MXW8?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)
- 6 AA battery holder
- Caster Wheel
- SG90 Servo
- Plastic piece to tuck inside the duck's head (In my case, it is a plastic gear)
- Rubber Duck (of course)

The chassis is made out of old notebooks covers glued together. Duct tape was used to embellish it. Above the chassis we can find Cyberduck with the Arduino Uno inside its body, a servo inside its neck and the laser pointer thrusted into its beak. I also used discarded 3D printed pieces for the bumper I glued the IR sensors to. As for the hubcaps in the robot's wheels, two plastic bottle caps were used. 

Other

- Various wires
- Soldering tin
- Glue sticks
